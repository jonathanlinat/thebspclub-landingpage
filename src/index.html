            <p>If you've stumbled upon this site, it's quite likely that you enjoy games related to <span class="featured-text">Quake</span>, <span class="featured-text">Half-Life</span>, or <span class="featured-text">Half-life 2</span>. What's more, you're probably also involved in <span class="featured-text">creating content</span> for either them, or one of their offsprings.</p>
            <p><span class="featured-text">Quake</span>, <span class="featured-text">Goldsrc</span> and <span class="featured-text">Source</span> have been amongs the most widely celebrated game engines through out the years (resp. <span class="featured-text">Doom</span>!), and are still being used as a creative outlet by an admirable number of people to this day.</p>
            <p><span class="featured-text">Coders</span>, <span class="featured-text">Mappers</span> and <span class="featured-text">Modelers</span> are each working away to create something fun and interesting. <span class="featured-text">So why not bring these people together</span>?</p>
            <p>The <span class="featured-text">BSP</span> Club is here for you to <span class="featured-text">showcase your progress</span>, <span class="featured-text">ask for help</span>, or simply <span class="featured-text">share your enthusiasm</span>.
